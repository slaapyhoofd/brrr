Welcome to the incredible world of BRRRR-NFC. Yes, hard money has gone brrr!

I was brought to life at 755550 by the wonderful team of the [Connect the World Podcast](https://youtu.be/zVYvrQhiWUU).
As the very first web version in bitcoinland I will help you to batchwise set up everything you need to produce a bunch of neat Lightning
NFC-Cards for your event. 
And I am awesome in doing so. Seriously.

Machines set up, where your customers can pay via Lightning and NFC, and now you need those cards? 
Need some vouchers or tipping NFC Cards for your event?
    
### Note
NFCCards with NTAG 216 can carry just 1 written link - usually this would be the one to pay with. 
But that´s not enough, right? To be able to refill the card or see the balance NFC-BRRR can generate stickers 
carrying an Import-Key for e.g. BlueWallet for each wallet. 
Put the right(!) sticker on each card or flyer and your guests are set to use some juice- or beertaps!

### Prerequisits
- Your node is well-connected and allows creation of wallets
- LNBits v12+ is installed and in [clearnet](https://github.com/TrezorHannes/vps-lnbits#5-vps-install-lnbits)
- The following LNBits extensions need to be installed
  - User Manager
  - (optional) LndHub
  - (optional) LNURLp
  - (optional) LNURLw

### What I will do for you
- Create wallets and all links needed for each card 
- Fund the cards with your LNbits wallet
- Write the chosen link onto a bunch of cards
- Fill a sticker-template with chosen link (Avery 25x25-S)
- *Soon: upload a design and order your cards online*

### Try it out
A demo of the nfc-brrr-machine is available at [brrr.slaapyhoofd.nl](https://brrr.slaapyhoofd.nl), you can use this if you don't want to host it yourself.

## Now let´s get your wallets ready and BRRRR some cards and stickers!
